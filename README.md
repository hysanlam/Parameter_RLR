# Parameter_RLR
This is a software library that reproduces numerical experiments from the manuscript by Daniel Kressner and Hei Yin Lam titled 'Randomized low-rank approximation of parameter-dependent matrices'.

The script for reproducing Figures 7 to 11 requires Chebfun2 and the Tensor toolbox. Additionally, we used the Parallel Computing Toolbox 'parfor' to speed up the computation.
