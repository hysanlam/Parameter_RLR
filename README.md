# Parameter_RLR
This is a software library that reproduces numerical experiments from the manuscript
Daniel Kressner, Hei Yin Lam:  "Randomized low-rank approximation of parameter-dependent matrices".

The script for reproducing Figures 7 to 11 requires Chebfun2 and Tensor toolbox. We also We also used the Parallel Computing Toolbox
parfor to speed up the computation.
